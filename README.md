## Contributing

### Guidelines

The documentation is divided into several sections with a different tone and purpose. If you plan to write more than a few sentences, you might find it helpful to get familiar with the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/docs.hackerone.com/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the appropriate sections.

### Create a branch

1. `git checkout master` from any folder in your local `docs.hackerone.com` repository
1. `git pull origin master` to ensure you have the latest main code
1. `git checkout -b the-name-of-my-branch` (replacing `the-name-of-my-branch` with a suitable name) to create a branch

### Make the change

1. Follow the "Running locally" instructions
1. Save the files and check in the browser
  1. Changes to React components in `src` will hot-reload
  1. Changes to markdown files in `docs` will hot-reload
  1. If working with plugins, you may need to remove the `.cache` directory and restart the server

### Test the change

1. If possible, test any visual changes in all latest versions of common browsers, on both desktop and mobile.

### Push it

1. `git add -A && git commit -m "My message"` (replacing `My message` with a commit message, such as `Fixed header logo on Android`) to stage and commit your changes
1. `git push my-fork-name the-name-of-my-branch`
1. Go to the [docs.hackerone.com repo](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/docs.hackerone.com), and you should see recently pushed branches.
1. Follow GitHub's instructions.
1. If possible, include screenshots of visual changes.

## Troubleshooting

- `yarn clean` to clear the local gatsby cache
- `yarn reset` to clear the local node.js cache
