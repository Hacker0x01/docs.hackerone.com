The HackerOne Leaderboards show which hackers are on top and where you personally stand in regard to different categories of leaderboards based on the selected time period.   

To view the leaderboards:
1. Log in to your HackerOne account.
2. Select **Leaderboards** in the top navigation.

Each hacker will have these visual progress markers to denote their movement trend on the leaderboards:

Marker | Details
------ | --------
![stay marker](./images/leaderboard-stay-marker.png) | The hacker hasn't moved on the leaderboard and has stayed in the same spot in the rankings.
![up marker](./images/leaderboard-up-marker.png) | The hacker has moved up in the rankings on the leaderboard.
![down marker](./images/leaderboard-down-marker.png) | The hacker has moved down in the rankings on the leaderboard.
