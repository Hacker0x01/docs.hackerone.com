The Directory is a community-curated resource that helps hackers identify the best way to contact an organization's security team. This guides hackers with reporting potential vulnerabilities directly to the organizations that can resolve them. The Directory is comprised of a list of various organizations that both use and don't use HackerOne. It documents the existence of an organization's vulnerability disclosure policy and any associated bug bounty programs.

### Directory Services
The Directory provides relevant information for both hackers and programs.

The Directory enables Hackers to:
* [Search](https://hackerone.com/directory) for an organization to get the contact information of a security team.
* Add security team contact information for an organization so that other hackers know where to submit vulnerabilities (See [Create a Directory Page](/hackers/create-a-directory-page.html))
   * As the directory is community-curated, hackers who maintain sufficient reputation have edit rights and can update information about an organization.  If you don’t have edit rights, you can reach a moderator at directory@hackerone.com with any changes.
* Find programs they're interested to hack on
* Bookmark their favorite programs  
* View and compare statistics of various programs

><i>Note: If an organization hasn't published security contact information anywhere, HackerOne recommends considering assistance from the [local CERT](https://www.first.org/members/teams/).</i>

The Directory enables programs to:
* Publish contact information for receiving information about potential vulnerabilities in their products or online services, such as a security@ email address or a HackerOne program (See [ISO 29147](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=45170) for additional guidance or [contact HackerOne](mailto:support@hackerone.com))
* [Search](https://hackerone.com/directory) for their organization to ensure that their security team's contact information and disclosure policy is accurate (See [Claiming the Security Page](/programs/security-page.html) if the program page hasn’t been claimed for editing)
