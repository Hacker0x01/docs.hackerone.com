### Priority vs Normal Payments
#### Why can’t I choose normal (local) payments instead of priority (swift) payments in a bank transfer?
You’re unable to use normal payment options because your bank doesn’t support such options. You’re instead defaulted to using priority payments. Some international payments require a SWIFT code in order for the money to be transferred. Please keep in mind that there’s a fee in processing your payment. If you don’t want to be charged the processing fee, you can look into other payout options such as PayPal or Coinbase. 

### SEPA
#### Is the transfer provided by CurrencyCloud a SEPA one when choosing EURO currency in the setup? 
Yes, the transfer is SEPA if you choose for a Normal payment. If you select for a Priority payment, it will go through Swift.

### Supported Currencies
#### Why can’t I receive payments in my currency?
Our 3 main payout providers are PayPal, Coinbase, and Currencycloud. You can only receive payments in the currencies these 3 options provide. If they don’t support your specified currency, then you unfortunately can’t receive payments in that currency. A work around for this is to receive your payment in US dollars and then have the funds converted to the currency you desire. 

### Payment Tracking
#### Where is my payment?
Keep in mind that it takes about 7-10 days to receive payments after it’s been awarded, and there must be a valid tax form on file as well as a payout method selected.
