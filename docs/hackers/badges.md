Badges are emblematic awards you can receive when you meet certain criteria or achieve events. Once received, these badges are publicly show-cased on your profile page to show your accomplishments and skills. See: hackerone.com/[hacker-name]/badges.

All badges are represented by different images of bugs. Some badges have many levels depending on different criteria. These levels are represented by stars on the badge.
