All hackers have an email alias on HackerOne that forwards any emails to the email address that was used to register with HackerOne. This provides an easy way for programs to contact you in order to share credentials and information without having to access your actual email address. Programs now no longer have to share credentials through excel spreadsheets, shared documents, or other means.

### How It Works
1. Upon creation of an account on HackerOne, the email alias will automatically generate based on the username you choose.
     * Email aliases will be in the form of: <b>`[username]@wearehackerone.com`</b>
2. Programs will email you using your email alias in order to share special credentials or to communicate with you.
3. The email will automatically be forwarded to your actual email address.

><i>Note: You can't send emails with your alias. You can only receive emails with your alias if it’s from an email address that’s not associated with your HackerOne account.</i>

### Multiple Aliases

You can have multiple email aliases tied to your HackerOne account. This enables you to create multiple test accounts on a program to be able to test different attack vectors on different account levels without having to create multiple HackerOne profile accounts.

You can create multiple email aliases through using **`[username]+[any_identifier]@wearehackerone.com`**. You can put anything you want behind the `+` sign to accommodate your needs. For instance, if you set up a test account using your default alias, `jobert@wearehackerone.com`, you can use `jobert+test2@wearehackerone.com` to create another test account.
