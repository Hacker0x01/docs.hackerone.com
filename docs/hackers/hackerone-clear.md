HackerOne Clear programs are programs that require proven hackers to be [background-checked](/hackers/background-checks.html) in order to participate in them. These programs require you to have extra screening due to the sensitive nature of their systems. Only hackers that are background-checked are able to participate in these programs.  

### What are the benefits of HackerOne Clear?
As a HackerOne Clear hacker, you'll be eligible to receive private program invites from programs that require Clear hackers. These programs will pay higher than average critical bounty payouts and could have some additional assets in scope that are only available to you as a Clear hacker. It's required that Clear programs set their [bounty tables](/organizations/bounty-tables.html) so that the minimum for a high vulnerability is $2000 and $5000 for a critical.

Additionally, you'll be invited to join a group Slack channel with the Clear program you're a part of so that you can better communicate with the program through Slack. *(The shared Slack channel is currently in beta. Only select Clear programs offer this.)*

### What distinguishes H1 Clear from the standard ID Verification process?

H1 Clear is a stricter and more thorough process that requires a more stringent background check, ensuring that only the most skilled and professional hackers receive this status. These hackers are granted additional benefits as a result. The standard ID Verification process is available to any hacker who has submitted a valid report, providing a convenient method for identity confirmation.
