With hacker mediation, hackers can request assistance from HackerOne in extreme cases when all normal discussions with the program have been attempted and there has been no satisfactory resolution. Vice versa, programs can also request for mediation when there are issues with hackers.

Hacker mediation requests commonly occur when a program's behavior is clearly out of sync with what is outlined on their Security Page. Examples include:
* A program promises to reply within a certain time period on their Security Page but fails to do so.
* A program claims a domain is in scope on their Security Page, then makes a last minute change to pull it out of scope based on your report.
* A program clearly outlines a vulnerability in a particular domain as being worth a minimum bounty, but then awards less than that amount or no bounty at all without providing an explanation.

While HackerOne can't guarantee a resolution or override a security team's assessment, hacker mediation is used to successfully bring issues to the security team's attention, which results in a more favorable outcome for everyone involved. Please keep in  mind that if a program is not managed or triaged by HackerOne, then the time to fully resolve the mediation might take longer than usual.

### Requesting Hacker Mediation
In order to request mediation:
1. Open the report you'd like to request HackerOne mediation support for.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the report.
3. Click **Request Mediation**.

4. Select the **Nature of dispute** in the Request Mediation form.

5. Click **Confirm**.

This will trigger a workflow to reach out to both the program and the relevant hacker.

When providing information about the mediation, please be as descriptive as possible about the nature of the disagreement. By default, the mediation team doesn’t have access to the original report as this is to protect the privacy of the information and parties involved in handling of reports. If no information is provided in the mediation request, this will increase the mediation response time, as the mediation team will have to take time to make sure they understand the context in order to provide the proper assistance.

> Note: Please don't share any report details with HackerOne in the initial request without explicit mutual agreement from the program. If more information is required to address the problem, HackerOne will arrange it with the program's security team.

### Hacker Mediation Triggers
Requesting hacker mediation triggers the following actions:
1. An email is sent to the program's security team, requesting that they make their best effort to resolve the issue with the hacker within 3 business days.

2. If the security team doesn't respond to the hacker or if the situation isn't resolved, HackerOne will evaluate all available information about the vulnerability report, the hacker who requested mediation, and the organization to determine the appropriate level of escalation.

3. If, in HackerOne's judgment, the hacker's case warrants bringing to the company's attention out of band, HackerOne's Customer Success team will do so.

4. If the security team is unable to respond to the hacker or if the situation is not promptly resolved, The Mediation team will contact all involved parties and work together with the hacker and program teams to gain an appropriate and timely outcome.

### Mediation requests vs Support Requests
Mediation requests are different from Support requests. When requesting for mediation, it’s important that you request for help for the right reasons, as some issues are best taken to HackerOne support instead.  Here’s a table to help you see the difference between the type of requests:

Support Request | Mediation Request
----------------- | ---------------
Request help with a payment that didn’t go through | Bounty disagreement (e.g: The bounty table specifies a different amount that the one awarded for this criticality)
Request credentials for a program | Resolution disagreement (e.g: The bug was marked as duplicate and the “original” report has an older report number)
Two-factor authentication resets | Unresponsiveness (e.g.: The triage team or the program provided no updates for a week)
Account deletion |
