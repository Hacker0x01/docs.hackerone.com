Public disclosure enables programs to be transparent about the security vulnerabilities found for their program. HackerOne's public disclosure process balances transparency with control over what information is shared with the public.  

Programs can choose from 3 disclosure settings:

Option | Detail
------ | -------
Disclosure by Default | You or the security team can request public disclosure for any closed report in the program. If the admin of the program agrees to disclosure, the contents of the report will be made public within 30 days.<br> <br>*This is the default setting for all verified programs*.
Disclosure requiring Mutual Agreement | You can request public disclosure for any closed report in the program. If the program security team agrees to disclosure, the contents of the report will be made public. If the security team doesn't take any action, the contents of the report will remain private. <br>*The program must request to opt-in to this option.*
Disclosure Disabled | Public disclosure isn't allowed for any report.

### Requesting Public Disclosure
Both you and program members can request public disclosure. To request public disclosure:
1) Go to the report you want to publicly disclose.
2) Make sure the report is closed.
3) Select **Request public disclosure** in the action picker at the bottom of the report.
4) Select whether you want to disclose the **Full** report or **Limited**.

Option | Details
------ | -------
Full | Upon public disclosure, the full contents of the report are visible including:<ul><li>Vulnerability information</li></ul><ul><li>Summary</li></ul><ul><li>Timeline such as comments and attachment</li></ul><br>*Note: Internal comments are hidden.*  
Limited | Only the summary and timeline of the activity are visible. All comments and attachments are hidden. Limited disclosure allows for greater control over sensitive or extraneous information.

5) *(Optional)* Enter a comment to describe your reasons for public disclosure.
6) Click **Post**.

When publishing reports, the security team can choose to disclose the report in full or limit the information published. The default is to display all the communication between the hacker and the security team from first report to resolution.
