The Hacker Dashboard enables you to view and manage all of your invitations.

### Overview

The Overview page is your guide to help you get started on HackerOne. You'll be directed to the right pages to help you get the information you need to successfully start out on HackerOne.

We also provide you with a getting started checklist with 4 tasks to complete. Completion of the tasks will help guide you to be more successful on the platform.

After you've submitted your first vulnerability, you'll be able to keep track of your statistics regarding the amount of bounties you've earned, the number of reports you've submitted, and your reputation. You can also view your top earning programs.

### My Programs

The My Programs page enables you to better manage all of the programs you're a part of. You can view the private programs you've accepted to participate in and the public programs you've hacked on.

For each program, you can view:
* The total number of reports resolved
* The minimum bounty
* The average bounty
* Your stats: The total number of reports you've submitted, the number of  reports that were valid, and the total amount of bounties you've earned

You can elect to leave the private programs that you no longer have interest to participate in by clicking **Leave Program** next to the program you want to leave.

### Pending Invitations

The Pending Invitations tab enables you to view all of the invitations that you havenâ€™t accepted.

For each program you have an invite to, you can view these options:

Option | Detail
------ | -------
Invitation Expiration Time | Invitations don't last forever! They have an expiration time where you can no longer take action to accept them.
Launch Date | The date the program started to accept vulnerabilities.
Bugs resolved | The total number of vulnerabilities the program has fixed.
[Response Efficiency](/programs/response-target-indicators.html) | The percentage of reports that are responded to on time within the last 90 days.
Minimum Bounty | The minimum bounty that will be given for a valid vulnerability. If the field is marked with a `-` this means that there is no minimum bounty, or the program chose not to display this information on their metric display settings.
Average Bounty | The average bounty that will be given for a valid vulnerability. If the field is marked with a `-` this means that there is no average bounty, or the program chose not to display this information on their metric display settings.

Click <b>View Invitation</b> to review the invitation and take action to accept or reject it.
