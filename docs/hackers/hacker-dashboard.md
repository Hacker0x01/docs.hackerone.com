After you've submitted your first vulnerability, you'll be able to keep track of your statistics regarding the amount of bounties you've earned, the number of reports you've submitted, and your reputation. You can also view your top earning programs.

The Pending Invitations tab enables you to view all of the invitations that you havenâ€™t accepted.

For each program you have an invite to, you can view these options:

Option | Detail
------ | -------
Invitation Expiration Time | Invitations don't last forever! They have an expiration time where you can no longer take action to accept them.
Launch Date | The date the program started to accept vulnerabilities.
Bugs resolved | The total number of vulnerabilities the program has fixed.
[Response Efficiency](/organizations/response-target-indicators.html) | The percentage of reports that are responded to on time within the last 90 days.
Minimum Bounty | The minimum bounty that will be given for a valid vulnerability. If the field is marked with a `-` this means that there is no minimum bounty, or the program chose not to display this information on their metric display settings.
Average Bounty | The average bounty that will be given for a valid vulnerability. If the field is marked with a `-` this means that there is no average bounty, or the program chose not to display this information on their metric display settings.

Click <b>View Invitation</b> to review the invitation and take action to accept or reject it.

### Bookmarked Programs

The Bookmarked Programs tab enables you to view the list of programs that you've marked as your favorites in the directory. This enables you to better keep track of the programs you're most interested in.
