### Hacker101 CTF
Hacker 101 also offers a Capture The Flag (CTF) game where you can hack and hunt for bugs in a safe environment. The CTF serves as the official coursework for the class. You can still access the old coursework on the [github repo](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/Hacker101Coursework).

Once you have earned 26 points in the CTF, you’ll be eligible to receive invitations to private programs.

4. Click <b>Go</b> to start capturing flags.

If you get stuck, you can select <b>Hints</b> to receive a hint. Keep in mind that most levels have a total of 3-5 hints, and hints can only be accessed on an increasing timer, as the time before accessing each subsequent hint increases.

Click <b>Restart</b> if your instance is bugging out or running slow. You won’t lose any of your captured flags for clicking Restart.

#### Groups
You can also create your own group and invite others to join your group, through which you can manage individuals and their progress in working through the CTF.
