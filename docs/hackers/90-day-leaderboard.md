### What is it?
The 90 day leaderboard shows the top 100 hackers based on their activity in the last 90 days.

### How do I access it?
Go to https://hackerone.com/leaderboard/invites.

### How do I become eligible for the leaderboard?
You’ll be eligible if within the last 90 days you have:
* Positive reputation gain
* Non-negative signal
* Zero code of conduct violations

### How do I move up in ranking?
Hackers are ranked by their score from the calculation:
**Reputation x Signal Percentile x Impact Percentile**

* **Reputation** is based on your report validity.
* **Signal** and **Impact Percentile** are calculated against all eligible hackers.
Increasing your reputation, signal, or impact will move you up on the leaderboard. As the leaderboard updates every day at 8:30am UTC, you can see how you rank with other hackers on a daily basis.

### Why should I care about my ranking?
The higher your rank, the higher your chance of receiving invitations to private programs.

For instance, if this is the state of the 90 day leaderboard:

1. Alice
2. Bob
3. Charlie
4. David

For each invitation that goes out, the chances for each hacker receiving the invite would be:

1. Alice: 40%
2. Bob: 30%
3. Charlie: 20%
4. David: 10%

><i>Note: Hackers in the priority queue will still be first to receive invitations.</i>
