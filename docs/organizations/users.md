### Adding Users
>Hint: Add groups before adding users to avoid adding people without any groups. Pending users can not be added to groups.

1. Go **Organization Settings > Users**
2. Click on **Add new user**
![Users page](/images/users-1.png)

3. Provide the email address of the user that should be invited.
	* Users who were already added cannot be added again.
4. Select if this user should be an organization administrator.
    * Adding a user as an organization administrator will allow them to add, manage, and remove other users, groups, and assets from the organization.
	* Every organization must have at least one admin.
5. Select the groups the user should be added to. Groups determine what users can access and do in your program.
    * By not adding a user to a group, they will be able to onboard onto the platform, but unable to access or take any action on the platform.
    * **Tip:** If you would like to add a user to a group that doesn’t exist yet, we recommend that you create the group first and then add the user.
6. Click on **Add new user** at the bottom of the page to finish.
7. This will trigger a single invitation to join the organization. Once the User accepts the invitation, they will have access based on the groups they were invited to. 

Once a user is added they will appear under **Pending users.** Users in this category can only be edited once they have been onboarded into the organization. 

>Note: Before a user is added we check the eligibility for the user to be invited based on which domains have been set up. This can be found and managed in **Authentication.**

### Editing & Removing Users
Edit users by clicking on the kabob menu next to their information and clicking **Edit User.**

You can also edit users by going to their overview page and clicking **Edit User.** The user’s profile will be shown, including user details, organization permissions, and program & asset permissions.

Selecting **Remove User** in either menu will remove the user from all groups.
