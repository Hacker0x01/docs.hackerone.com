## Structure

By adhering to a structured testing approach, HackerOne aims to deliver consistent, high-quality pentest results
tailored to the unique security requirements of our customers. The five key components of our pentest approach are
explained below:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td nowrap><b>Team Composition</b></td>
<td><ul><li>Every pentest is led by one Lead Pentester.</li><li>Up to four additional pentesters may be included in the team, depending on the scope and requirements.</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap><b>Pentest Tiers</b></td>
<td><ul><li>Pentests are categorized into two <a href="/hackers/background-checks.html">distinct tiers</a>: the Essential and the Premium.</li><li>Each tier carries its unique responsibilities, ensuring a tailored approach to different security needs.</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap><b>Duration and Effort</b></td>
<td><ul><li>All pentests, irrespective of their size or tier, are designed to run over a span of two calendar weeks (14 days) unless specified otherwise.</li><li>Every pentester involved is expected to commit a total of forty hours of effort during this period.</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap><b>Retesting Phase</b></td>
<td><ul><li>Following the main testing phase, a retesting window opens.</li><li>Pentesters assigned will be responsible for conducting retests during this period.</li><li>The duration of the retesting window is contingent upon the assessment tier chosen.</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap><b>Peer Review</b></td>
<td><ul><li>Collaboration is paramount to ensure consistency across each engagement.</li><li>At the end of each engagement, pentesters are required to review and provide feedback on their teammates' contributions, ensuring continuous improvement and cohesion within the team.</li></ul></td>
</tr>

## Scoping

The scoping of a pentest serves two functions: to identify the target of the test and to calculate the size of the test.
The output of scoping is:

- **The technical scope of the test:** The assets and user roles to be tested
- **The size of test:** How many people/hours and what type of skills are needed to complete the test to a high quality
  standard
- **A commercial quotation:** How much this will cost

The target of the test is the set of digital assets that will be assessed in the 2 week testing period by the pentesting
team. The type of asset determines the checks that must be completed, the pentester skill requirements and the tier (
essentials or premium). For example, when an Android mobile application is added to a HackerOne Pentest scope, the
Android security checklist is added, pentesters are selected with skills and tools needed to audit Android applications,
and the test will be defined as a premium test to reflect the increased complexity of testing (over a simple web
application).

The size of the test is the number of hours needed to achieve coverage of the test targets. The size is calculated from
the type of asset and qualities such as the number of functions that an application performs and the number of user
roles.

## Size

There are five different units of measurement we use to define various pentest sizes that HackerOne offers. These sizes
are calculated based on the testing hours needed per pentest, depending on the scope.

All pentesters, including Leads, are expected to spend forty (40) hours of effort across all pentest sizes. Pentests are
named based on the number of hours the assessment requires for the whole team and referred to as the following:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
    <th>Pentest Size</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th># of Lead Pentester</th>
    <th># of Supporting Pentester(s)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <td><b>P40</b></td>
        <td>Lead pentester performs all of the work by themselves.</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>P80</b></td>
        <td>Lead pentester and a supporting pentester share the work.</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>P120</b></td>
        <td>Lead pentester and 2 supporting pentesters share the work.</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>P160</b></td>
        <td>Lead pentester and 3 supporting pentesters share the work.</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>P200</b></td>
        <td>Lead pentester and 4 supporting pentestesr share the work.</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>>P200</b></td>
        <td colspan="3">Contact your dedicated pentest team for custom sizing tailored to larger environments and multiple tests.</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>

## Tiers

Regardless of the size and scope, all pentests are categorized on the platform into two distinct tiers: Essential and
Premium. There are several fundamental differences between these two tiers, which are detailed below.
