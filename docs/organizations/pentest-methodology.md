HackerOne's testing methodologies are grounded in the principles of the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten), [Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)](https://pentest-standard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Open Source Security Testing Methodology (OSSTM)](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf), and are tailored to various assessment types including Web Application, API, Mobile (iOS and Android), External Network, and Internal Network.

Our methodology is more than just a list of best practices; it's a dynamic, continuously-evolving approach that ensures comprehensive and deep coverage for each engagement. This approach stems from:

 - Consultations with both internal and external industry experts.
 - Leveraging and adhering to recognized industry standards.
 - Gleaning insights from a vast array of global client programs, spanning both time-bound and ongoing engagements.
 - Detailed analysis of millions of vulnerability reports we receive through our platform (see [Hacktivity page](https://hackerone.com/hacktivity/overview) for details).

With an ever-evolving landscape of threats, our methodology isn't stagnant. HackerOneâ€™s Assessments delivery and security advisory services (SAS) teams constantly refine and adapt based on feedback and real-world experiences, delivering unparalleled security assurance.
