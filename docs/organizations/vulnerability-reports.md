HackerOne works to provide organizations with the tools they need to successfully run their own vulnerability coordination program. HackerOne doesn't have access to your confidential vulnerability reports. HackerOne will never share your confidential data with any other parties. HackerOne is happy to accept report submissions encrypted with the Response Teams's PGP key. For more details, view our [Privacy Policy](https://www.hackerone.com/privacy).

All traffic to and from the hackerOne servers is encrypted. Your security team can use the HackerOne IP allowlist policy so your data can only be accessed from locations you control. [Learn more about HackerOne security](https://hackerone.com/security).
