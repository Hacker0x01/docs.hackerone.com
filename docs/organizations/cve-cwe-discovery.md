CVE & CWE Discovery helps you discover trends in common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) and common weakness enumerations (CWEs). By better understanding the vulnerability landscape, you can harden your organization against new threats and gain insight into existing threats that are still being exploited in the wild. 

To start using this feature:
1. Go to **Hacktivity**
2. Select either the **CVE Discovery** or **CWE Discovery** tab
3. Use the search bar to filter results
4. Click on an item in the table to drill down into CVE or CWE details 

### Use Cases
#### Explore trending vulnerabilities 
With the Discovery Search feature, you can search across identifiers, products, vendors, and descriptions to pinpoint the most relevant vulnerabilities for your organization.

#### Identify related reports 
With the Related Reports feature on the CWE Details panel, you can explore publicly disclosed reports related to that CWE for an even deeper dive into how these weaknesses are being actively exploited.

#### Prioritize threats
With the H1 Rank for CVEs, you can see which vulnerabilities we believe have the highest impact. You can also gain further insight into the number of reports, the severity, and the remediation time for related reports by drilling down into the CVE Details or CWE Details panels. 
The H1 Rank is determined by a combination of the number of hacker reports from valid proof of concept (PoC) exploits for HackerOne customers, severity, and recency of reports.
