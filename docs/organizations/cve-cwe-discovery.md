CVE & CWE Discovery helps you discover trends in common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) and common weakness enumerations (CWEs). By better understanding the vulnerability landscape, you can harden your organization against new threats and gain insight into existing threats still being exploited in the wild.

1. To start using this feature:
1. Go to **Hacktivity**
1. Select either the **CVE Discovery** or **CWE Discovery** tab
1. Use the search bar to filter results
1. Click on an item in the table to drill down into CVE or CWE details

### Use Cases
#### Explore Trending Vulnerabilities
With the Discovery Search feature, you can search across identifiers, products, vendors, and descriptions to pinpoint the most relevant vulnerabilities for your organization.

#### Identify Related Reports
With the Related Reports feature on the CWE Details panel, you can explore publicly disclosed reports related to that CWE for an even deeper dive into how these weaknesses are being actively exploited.

#### Prioritize Threats
With the H1 Rank for CVEs, you can see which vulnerabilities we believe have the highest impact. You can also gain further insight into the number of reports, the severity, and the remediation time for related reports by drilling down into the CVE Details or CWE Details panels. 

We combine the number of hacker reports from valid proof of concept (PoC) exploits for customers and recency of reports to determine a hacker’s H1 Rank. It is calculated by aggregating the scores of its related submissions. Newer reports receive higher scores that decrease over time, with reports older than 12 weeks receiving the minimum score.

### EPSS in Hacktivity
HackerOne integrates EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) into Hacktivity. EPSS is a new industry standard that offers a real-time exploitability assessment for each CVE. Its goal is to inform us about the risk of exploitation by using a predictive model for a more accurate likelihood assessment.

An EPSS score estimates the probability of observing in-the-wild exploitation attempts against that vulnerability in the next 30 days and enhances your vulnerability backlog prioritization efforts.

EPSS scores are now directly integrated into Hacktivity’s CVE Discovery page on HackerOne. By integrating CVSS ratings, EPSS, and our platform intelligence, customers gain a competitive edge in CVE remediation. This approach empowers enterprises to prioritize and establish risk-aligned remediation SLAs more effectively.
