Webhooks enable you to build your own real-time integrations that subscribe to certain report and program events on HackerOne. When an event is triggered, HackerOne will send an HTTP POST payload to the webhook’s configured URL. [View the API documentation for webhooks](https://api.hackerone.com/webhooks/#webhooks).

Some examples of what webhooks can be used for include:
* Updating an external issue tracker
* Triggering a notification system
* Updating a report’s data backup
* Triggering provisioning for a user account when a hacker joins your private program

They can be created on a program level and are bound to the permissions of the user that creates the webhook.

> **Note:** Webhooks are only available for Enterprise programs.
