The Sessions page enables you to review and manage all of your HackerOne sessions on all of the devices you’ve signed in to within the last 90 days. All sessions are stored with an IP address and user agent that you can revoke at any time.  

To manage your sessions:
1. Go to your profile’s <b>Settings > Sessions</b>.
2. Click <b>Revoke</b> for the devices you want to sign out of. The Revoke button will cancel your session on that device.

The next time you log in to your account on a new or previously revoked device, you’ll be asked to log in again.
