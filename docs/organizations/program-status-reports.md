A Program Status Report (PSR) is a self-service feature that provides a summary of findings for your BBP and VDP programs. PSRs are generated dynamically from your date inputs and filters, and you can download them as PDFs once they're generated.

Key sections of a PSR include:
* Executive Summary
* Methodology
* Findings by Asset & Severity
* Assets Covered
* Appendix
    * Vulnerability Details
    * Remediation Status
    * Researchers list

To start using PSRs, go to your Organizationâ€™s Analytics hub via the navigation sidebar and select the **Program Status Reports** tab.

Once satisfied with the contents of the report, click the **Generate Report** button to save it and return to the list view of your reports. Reports that you generate are only viewable to you.

### Downloading a PSR
To download a PSR, click on the download icon on the right side of the table containing your reports. This will trigger a PDF download in your browser. 

### Modifying a PSR
Although the PDF content of a PSR cannot be modified after generation, a report can be renamed via the options menu on the right side of the table containing your reports. A report can also be deleted via the same menu, and reports can be bulk deleted by selecting the checkboxes in the reports table and using the trash icon in the upper right corner of the page.
