If a key member of your security team goes on vacation or will be unavailable for a short period of time, be transparent with your hackers and let them know that your internal security resources will be limited for a bit. To notify hackers, you can:
1. Use a trigger to set an automated response
2. Update your Security Page by stating that response, triage, and resolution will take longer than normal

It's best if you include as much information as possible and a timeline of when you expect your program to resume.

HackerOne doesn't recommend that you pause submissions as it can be difficult to re-engage hackers after the pause ends. If you expect the disruption to last for a significant amount of time, please [contact HackerOne](https://support.hackerone.com) to discuss your situation.
