The Bounty Dashboard shows metrics on payments made to hackers for all the bug bounty programs of your organization on the HackerOne platform. You can export all of your data at once as a PDF or by sections as a CSV, PDF, or PNG image file. You can apply the filters described in the previous section to review this data by date range or assets. 

>Note: As part of the new org-level navigation with the left-side menu, analytics is now available at (a) a program-level from the Engagements page for your organization, and (b) org-level, across multiple programs in your organization, by clicking on the left-side  Analytics icon. 

  
### Bounty, and Bounty Awarded by Severity
The Bounty chart shows the amount of bounty payments made to hackers during the selected time period. The Bounty awarded by Severity chart shows how reports are distributed by severity levels.

### Bounty Awarded by Weakness and by Asset
The Bounty awarded by weakness chart shows how your payments are spread among the different weakness types. This can be a strong indicator of the type of coding and logic errors in your applications and can be used to direct developer training and secure application development practices. The Bounty awarded by asset chart is a summary of payments across your assets. You can use the filters described in the previous section to correlate information between the different charts to better understand the security health status of your assets.
