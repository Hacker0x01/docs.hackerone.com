The Submissions & Bounty Dashboard shows metrics data on hacker submissions for your programs. Bounty programs will show the number of valid submissions for that category on the left, with bounties paid out for that category on the right. You can export all of your data at once as a PDF or by sections as a CSV, PDF, or PNG image file.

### Summary
The Summary section at the top shows a row of cards which provide a quick overview of your report submission metrics. All submissions data is anchored by the report's submission date, and all bounty data is anchored by the bounty awarded date.

Item | Details
---- | ----------
Submissions |The total number of reports submitted to the program during the selected time interval.
Resolved or Triaged | The number of reports submitted during the selected time interval that are currently Triaged or closed as Resolved.
Valid | The percentage of valid reports submitted during the selected time interval. Percentage is calculated by dividing the total number of resolved or triaged reports by the total number of submissions.
Bounty Awarded | The amount of bounty paid out during the selected time interval.
Reports Awarded | The number of reports that received an award during the selected time period.

### Weakness
The Weakness section shows how your reports are spread among the different weakness types. You can view what areas you’re receiving the most valid vulnerabilities in so that you can know which vulnerabilities your program is most susceptible to.

You can see your weakness data by the number of valid reports and also by bounty amounts.

### Functionality
The date and filter section allows you to set the date range and interval of your results, as well as filter the results based on severity, current report state, assets, weaknesses, or anchor date.

To change the interval, select an option in the dropdown next to the date range and choose an interval based on your selected date range. For example, if you choose a date range of 1 year, your interval options may be “yearly” or “quarterly”.
