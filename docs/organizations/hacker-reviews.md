With Hacker Reviews, you have the option to send comments on hacker behavior to HackerOne and the hacker after closing a report. The reviews also enable the reviewer to highlight a key behavior which allows HackerOne to award or assist the hacker accordingly. Positive reviews can be added as a testimonial to the hacker's profile page.

When giving a review, you can:
* Choose whether to provide a positive or negative rating for the hacker.
* Select 1 of 4 preselected areas where the hacker excelled.
* Provide feedback to hackers and HackerOne about hacker behavior.
