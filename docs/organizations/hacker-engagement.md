The Hacker Engagement dashboard shows metrics on hacker participation in your programs. Close attention to this data and follow-up actions will ensure that you have a healthy count of participating hackers for running a successful bug bounty and vulnerability disclosure program (VDP). These provide a deeper insight into how many hackers submit valid reports and how many return to your program over time.

The data displayed is for the time period chosen with the date picker at the right-top. For example, if the yearly option is selected with dates from 09-Dec-2021 to 09-Dec-2022, then the data is shown for the entire year of 2022. Also, the data shown in the charts is for the beginning to end of the reporting interval (month, quarter, or year). 

>Note: As part of the new org-level navigation with the left-side menu, analytics is now available at (a) a program-level from the Engagements page for your organization, and (b) org-level, across multiple programs in your organization, by clicking on the left-side Analytics icon. 

### Hacker Participation
