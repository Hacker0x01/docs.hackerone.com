Your policy will be read by participating security hackers and should clearly state what you're looking for in your vulnerability disclosure program. In order to help you write a good policy, HackerOne provides a baseline policy on your Security Page to help you get started.  We recommend including the following in your policy:

Section | Details
----- | -----
Disclosure Policy | Provide a basic disclosure agreement for your invited hackers. One easy way is to state that you'll abide by [HackerOne's disclosure guidelines](https://www.hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines). 
Bounty Program | Define the vulnerability types you care about most and provide information on your reward structure.
Exclusions | Create exclusions for the vulnerabilities hackers should ignore.
Scope | List the assets in scope for your program.

Some successful security pages you can refer to as examples are: [Twitter](https://hackerone.com/twitter), [Yahoo](https://hackerone.com/yahoo).

Other best practices to keep in mind are:
* **Keep your policy succinct.** Longer policies may lose readership toward the end.
* **Set clear expectations with hackers.** If your response time or fix time is much longer than recommended, state it in your policy. It's good practice to respond to researchers within 3-5 days and to have complete fixes within 45 days.
* **Give responses updating a hacker that you're still reviewing a report.** Such actions let hackers know that their work hasn't gone into a black hole.
* **Re-evaluate your policy on a recurring basis.** Your policy will and should change as your bug bounty program matures.
