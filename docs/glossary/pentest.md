Short for penetration test. It's a type of test where authorized hackers broadly test the attack surface of an application and determine whether they can find vulnerabilities in them. At HackerOne, pentests are completed by following a structured testing methodology that involves checklists that incorporate the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
