### Reputation on Triage
No need to wait for reports to be resolved in order to increase reputation! We now enable hackers to gain reputation whenever their reports are marked as <i>Triaged</i>. 

### Bounty Tables
Instead of having programs manually create their own bounty table on the policy page using tedious markdown, we now enable them to easily generate their own bounty table with our new [bounty table](https://docs.hackerone.com/programs/bounty-tables.html) tool.
