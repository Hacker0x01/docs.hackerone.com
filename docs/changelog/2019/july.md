### Newly Designed Program Profile Page
We've redesigned the program profile pages to give them a sleeker look.

### Link Burp Suite with the HackerOne Scope
It can take a long time to set up Target Scope in Burp Suite, especially for programs with long or complicated scopes. Now you can download a Burp Suite project file to link HackerOne scope to the Burp Suite Target Scope.

### Bounty Eligibility Indicator on Structured Scopes
We've updated the structured scopes table on the program policy page with a new bounty eligible and ineligible icon to clearly show which assets are eligible and ineligible for bounties.
