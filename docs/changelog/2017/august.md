### Directory Icons and Program Badges
The Directory page now includes pink and purple lightning icons to highlight programs that are:
* Fast to respond with a first response in <48 hours on average
* Fast to award by giving a bounty <14 days after submission

We also include a <i>Managed</i> badge to identify programs that are managed by HackerOne.
