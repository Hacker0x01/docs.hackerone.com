### Beta Hacker VPN
We've implemented a hacker VPN that:
* Controls traffic to in scope program assets
* Enforces granular access controls with a 1:1 mapping between an individual hacker and a static IP
* Pauses individual hacker access without interruption to the overall program
* Integrates with a program's monitoring tools to have full visibility into program activity 

Contact [HackerOne](https://support.hackerone.com) to participate in this beta.
