### Retesting Enhancement
The tester will now have 72 hours to complete retesting once a retest is claimed.

### Program Hacker Matching Improvement
Weâ€™ve made improvements to our Invitation Engine. Using program requirements and customer preferences to match hackers to opportunities, we provide our hacker community with much more personalized recommendations.

### Organization Settings Page
The Organization Settings page allows customers with multiple programs to manage users from a single page.

### Program Dashboard Enhancements
We released fixes and performance optimizations to ensure consistent data between the Statistics page and the [Submissions and Bounty dashboard.](/organizations/submissions-bounty-dashboard.html)

### Team Member Eligibility
[Team Member Eligibility](/organizations/team-member-eligibility.html) settings allow you to configure a list of email domains that are eligible to join your program. These settings will allow or block a user when accepting an invitation, but will not affect any users that are already a member of the program. You can set team member eligibility regardless of SAML usage.
