### Comment Auto-Save
Comment auto-save is now available for all customers! We expect all users to benefit from having their draft comments saved and restored automatically.

How to use it: Sign in and start writing a comment on any reports; your draft will be saved every few seconds, so you can reload the page and see the draft appear again on the page. The draft is deleted once you publish your comment.



### Custom Hacker Templates
Custom Hacker Templates are available to all HAB members and HSM hackers! The Custom Hacker Templates will help hackers be more effective and spend less time submitting a new report by automating the report submission form filled with predefined description, impact, and severity. The templates also help Customers and Triagers to receive more standardized and predictable reports. This feature is currently in Beta testing. 

To use Custom Hacker Templates, 
* Go to [https://hackerone.com/settings/report_templates](https://hackerone.com/settings/report_templates)
* Click **Create a new template**
* Select the template on the Report Submission page



### Auto-Save Pentest Scoping
Auto-save is now active for all Pentest Scoping! This feature allows users to avoid losing valuable productivity if they forget to save their scoping questionnaire progress. All scoping questionnaires will auto-save as drafts as they are being filled out. 

Improved security: The pre-sales scoping questionnaire auto-expires after 30 days. The user access token expires after 7 days (can easily be renewed by the original email recipient)
*While the link can be shared, it is recommended that only one user is in the scoping form at a time to reduce the risk of data loss/overwrite*
