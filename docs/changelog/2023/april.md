### Hacktivity Annotations
Publicly disclosed reports are now automatically summarized using AI to make them even easier to consume. Summaries are provided in five languages. 

### Enhanced Opportunities Search
Hackers can now search for :mag: Opportunities by program handle, policy, technologies, industry, and asset identifiers through the search field. This update makes it possible to quickly and accurately locate the most relevant opportunities, increasing hacker's chances of finding the correct program to submit a report.

### Scope Management
We're excited to announce that we released Scope Management to all customers. We've entirely revamped our data model to support new functionality and scale our platform into a multi-product one.

Customer benefits:
* Centralized interface to manage assets on the organization level through the new Asset Inventory
* Introduced new asset types for Wildcards and Smart contracts
* Manage scope across engagements and products from a unified asset list

Hacker benefits:
* We're now supporting larger scopes. Customers can put more assets in the scope of a program, which will benefit hackers
* Search, filter, and export options will make it easier for hackers to consume large scopes
* New asset types will make finding the right program to hack on easier

### ID Verification
We are excited to announce the first iteration of :idv: ID Verification, a light version of H1 Clear! Hackers will now be able to go through a self-service ID verification process to instantly confirm their identity. 
Any hacker with a valid report can apply and get that sweet green checkmark on their profile.

This initial release is just the beginning. Future releases will enable programs to invite only ID-verified hackers to their programs. This will give programs access to ID-verified hackers without purchasing the H1 Clear product. 

### H1 Campaigns
Campaigns are time-bound promotions where the submitters get a higher bounty than usual for a valid report. H1 Campaigns are available for all customers using the Enterprise edition of HackerOne Bounty. Customers that had access to Campaigns before general availability will still keep their access. There is also a new Campaign Manager that allows you to see all of your campaigns at a glance.
