### Export Assets
With the new "Assets CSV Export" feature, customers can now easily export their asset data, including asset name, URL, associated tags, associated scope, risk, and other data. This feature allows customers to export their assets in bulk and apply filters based on their search criteria, saving them time and effort. 

### Asset Inventory Filter by Program
We've made managing multiple programs easier by allowing you to filter assets for a specific program. Get a quick overview of what's in or out of scope for that particular program by filtering for it.

### Scope Changelog Only Shows Changed Assets
Our scope changelog now shows only the changed assets, supporting growing scopes and making it easier for hackers to view changes. Scan for changes easily and efficiently.

### Program-Specific Scope Instructions
Our new scope tab on the asset inventory allows you to quickly see where assets are in scope and out of scope. With program-specific scope instructions, you can provide specific instructions based on the program in which you're testing the asset. Provide hackers with more detailed insights and optimize your testing strategies.

### The Scope Tab Defaults To An Ungrouped View
We learned that it’s important to highlight assets and their instructions directly when navigating to the scope page of your program. We’ve changed the behavior of the scope page to default to an ungrouped view and made the grouping by domain an optional view for hackers. 

### Scope Intro For Vulnerability Disclosure Programs
Most VDP programs have an open scope. With our scope introduction feature, you can define a free-form text on top of the scope page, avoiding showing "No assets in scope.”. Keep hackers engaged and informed, and provide them with clear instructions for testing.

### Pentest Cloning and Naming
Customers can now choose to clone an existing pentest when making a new one, and pentests can now have custom names. When creating a new pentest, customers can select the option to clone an existing pentest instead. This will prepopulate the form with details from the original pentest such as scope, asset details, and contact preferences.
