### Campaigns
All Enterprise and Professional bounty customers now have Campaigns available to use. Reach out to learn how to enable it for your program.

### Lead Pentester
Lead pentesters can now apply as a lead or team member, allowing pentesters more flexibility to pick up pentest opportunities. Lead pentesters can use this when they wish to apply to an assessment but do not wish to perform the additional lead responsibilities.

### Command Palette
The Command Palette is now available to all hackers. It provides a natural language input to let the user navigate the platform. It can also be used to quickly look up useful information such as CWE description, resume a report draft, or toggle platform themes. 

### Opportunities Search - Relevance Sort
Opportunities search now has a results-sorting option for **Relevance**.

### Explore
All customers have access to the beta of the new Explore functionality. This allows them to understand what data makes up dashboard charts for a better understanding of their metrics. 
To use:
* Go to Analytics > Dashboards or Engagements > [Select a Bounty program] > Dashboard. 
* Find a bar chart of interest, select the dropdown menu from the kabob menu (three vertical dots) 
* Select "Explore." 
*Note: this feature is currently only available on bar charts.*

### Exporting Reports
Weâ€™ve improved the Report Export feature with UX improvements to simplify the exporting functionality. Check out the before and after below.

### User Management 2.0
We are excited to announce the launch of User Management 2.0. The launch introduces two key areas of change - the Users and Groups in the organization settings. 
From the Users page you can now invite Users to the organization and grant access to programs through groups, view groups the user has access to, and view inbox, program, and assets access each group has.
From the Groups page, you can now grant access to multiple programs via a single group. Each group lists the organization, program, inbox, and asset inventory. Additionally, from the same page, you can edit the groups and filter by groups, programs, and permissions with the support of advanced filters. 
Finally, if you are the organization administrator, you can delete all groups, except the HackerOne Triage group of course.
These changes simplify the views and reduce the level of effort for our customers in management of access controls within the HackerOne platform.
For more information, please visit the [User Management](/docs/organizations/user-management.html) page on our doc site. 

### Trend Data
Trend analysis data is now publicly available for all weaknesses (CWEs). CWE IDs in markdown will now automatically open @Hacker0x01 trend data and allow you to discover related vulnerabilities on the platform.

### Encode and Decode
Encode and decode text straight from HackerOne! Users often need to encode or decode payloads from reports in order to reproduce or retest them. Use this feature by selecting text and clicking *Editor*.

### Performance Dashboard
Hackers can now access advanced data exploration, enabling deeper insights into data through their Performance Dashboard. Now hackers can know exactly which data makes up a chart or number. 

### Hacktivity Discovery
Better Hacktivity discovery! Publicly disclosed reports now have a section that lets anyone discover similar security vulnerabilities based on CWE through Hacktivity.
