### Submissions & Bounty Dashboard
The [Submissions & Bounty Dashboard](/organizations/submissions-bounty-dashboard.html) shows data on all report submissions broken up by different metrics. Bounty programs will show the number of valid submissions for that category on the left, with bounties paid out for that category on the right. You can export all of your data at once as a PDF or by sections as a CSV file.
