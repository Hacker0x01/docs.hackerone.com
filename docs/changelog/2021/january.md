### Retesting Available by Default
All Professional and Enterprise programs can now participate in retesting as retests are now included by default rather than as a separate add-on. For Response programs using HackerOne's triage services, the triage team will retest the vulnerabilities to verify the fixes instead of hackers.

If you're currently running a Bounty or Challenge program, awards for retests will be paid from your bounty pool. If you're using the consumption tier to pay for your bounties, payments for retests will count towards the tier instead.
