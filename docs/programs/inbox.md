All vulnerability reports submitted to your program are sent directly to the inbox where you can view and manage your reports.

The inbox contains these different features to help you manage your reports:
* [Inbox views](inbox-views.html)
* Filters
* Search
* [Response labels](response-labels.html) (only if your program doesn't meet response targets or standards)
