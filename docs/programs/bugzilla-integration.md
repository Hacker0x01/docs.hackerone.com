With the Bugzilla integration, HackerOne makes it easy for you to track Bugzilla issues as references on HackerOne.

In order to configure the Bugzilla integrations for your program, [contact HackerOne](https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with the following information to start the integration process:

  - The Base URL of your instance (e.g. https://company.bugzilla.com/)
  - Product

HackerOne can pre-fill any fields you’d like including any custom fields you may have created. Just let HackerOne know what you’d like those fields to map from.

With all of the provided information, HackerOne will be able to set up your requested integration. You’ll get an email notification letting you know that your integration has been set up within 1-2 business days.

### How the Integration Works
After your Bugzilla integration has been set up:
1. Change the action picker to **Change state > Triaged** in your report.

3. Submit the issue to create the report in Bugzilla.
4. Copy the Bugzilla report issue number and paste it in the **Reference ID** field back in the HackerOne.
5. Click **Create** to create a direct reference link to the issue in Bugzilla.
