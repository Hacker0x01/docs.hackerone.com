There are various programs in HackerOne that are associated with 1 larger organization. Such programs are referred to as parent/child programs, where the parent program is the primary account, and any subsequent child is a subordinate program that is linked to the parent. 

For example, Zillow (the main organization) has multiple programs associated with it such as zillow, hotpads, trulia, and zillowgroup. zillow is the parent program, whereas hotpads, trulia, zillowgroup and any other program that comes under Zillow are considered child programs. 

Child programs still function as their own program in which they still need to:
* Set their program settings
* Invite their own hackers
* Manage their own reports

Parent/child programs, however, have the option to share a bounty pool so that the organization doesn’t need to allocate specific dollar amounts for each program but rather, they can pull their funds from a master pool. 

### Transferring Reports between Parent/Child Programs
Parent programs can transfer reports to child programs and vice versa. As the report is transferred from one program to another, it appears in the transferred program’s inbox with an activity log about the transfer.
