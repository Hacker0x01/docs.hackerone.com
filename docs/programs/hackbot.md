Hackbot is HackerOneâ€™s free automated service that provides in-context guidance by suggesting key features and actions on the platform in order to save you time and effort.

For example, HackBot can identify potential duplicates and related reports to help you associate and close reports more quickly. It can also identify out of scope domains and suggest a pre-submission trigger that'll warn hackers in the act of submitting a report for the out of scope domain.

Hackbot offers suggestions that are visible only to your security team as internal comments, and it will not require any action on your behalf.
