IP allowlists is a security feature that permits teams to control which IP ranges their team members must be coming from in order to access HackerOne. You can configure IP allowlists with these addresses:
* IPv4
* IPv6
* CIDR

[Contact HackerOne](https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you'd like to enable this feature for your team.
