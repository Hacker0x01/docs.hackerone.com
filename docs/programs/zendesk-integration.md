With the Zendesk integration, HackerOne makes it easy for you to track Zendesk issues as references on HackerOne.

In order to configure the Zendesk integration for your team, [contact HackerOne](https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with the following information:  

* The base URL of the Zendesk instance (e.g. https://company.zendesk.com/)
* Any other custom/specific fields you’d like pre-populated such as:
  * locale_id
  * set_tags
  * via_id
  * client
  * submitted_from
  * Ticket_from_search

With all of the provided information, HackerOne will be able to set up your requested integration. You’ll get an email notification letting you know that your integration has been set up within 1-2 business days.

### How the Integration Works
After your Zendesk integration has been set up:
1. Change the action picker to **Change state > Triaged** in your report.
