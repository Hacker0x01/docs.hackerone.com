With the GitLab integration, HackerOne makes it easy for you to track GitLab issues as references on the platform. GitLab only supports directly linking to the issue creation form on a per-repository basis, so if you use multiple repositories, there currently isn’t a good way of pre-filling data as a report could affect different repositories. If most of your reports only affect one repository, issue creation can be much easier.

In order to configure the GitLab integration for your team, [contact HackerOne](https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with the following information:

- Are you using gitlab.com or GitLab Community/Enterprise Edition?
- The repository name
- The organization name
- The repository URL

If you have various repositories under one organization, HackerOne can set your reference URL to be https://gitlab.com/:org/. This will enable you to set your references to be equal to :repo/issues/:id, and that would link you directly there.

If you’d rather put the full GitLab URL as the reference ID, HackerOne can link that directly.  The integration set up is flexible, just let HackerOne know what works best for you.

With all of the provided information, HackerOne will be able to set up your requested integration. You’ll get an email notification letting you know that your integration has been set up within 1-2 business days.

### How the Integration Works
After your GitLab integration has been set up:
1. Change the action picker to **Change state > Triaged** in your report.

4. Click **Generate escalation**. You’ll be taken to your GitLab account where the report is pre-populated.
3. Submit the issue to create the report in GitLab.
4. Copy the GitLab report issue number and paste it in the **Reference ID** field back in the HackerOne.
5. Click **Create** to create a direct reference link to the issue in GitLab.
