[Hacktivity](https://hackerone.com/hacktivity?sort_type=popular&filter=type%3Aall&page=1&range=forever) is HackerOne's community feed that showcases hacker activity on HackerOne. It also serves as a resource that enables hackers to search for reports regarding programs and weaknesses they're interested in so that they can see how specific weaknesses were exploited in various programs.

You can sort your Hacktivity feed by:

Option | Details
---- | --------
Popular | Activities are listed based what's currently trending. They are ranked on the page primarily by their aggregated upvotes. The vote is weighted slightly more if it comes from a hacker with high [signal](signal-and-impact.html). Additionally, each activity gets an initial boost if it is resolved and/or receives an above average bounty.
New | Activities are ordered chronologically with the latest activity being listed on top. A previously appeared vulnerability goes back to the top when there is new activity on the report.

You can also filter the activity you want to see by these filters:

Filter Option | Details
------------- | --------
All | Shows all activities that appear on Hacktivity.
Bug Bounty | Only shows activities on reports that are submitted to programs that provide bounties.
