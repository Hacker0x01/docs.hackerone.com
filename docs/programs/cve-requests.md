The CVE, short for common vulnerabilities and exposures, is a directory of publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities that you can freely search, use, and incorporate into products and services.  Each vulnerability is referenced by a CVE ID to easily identify them. You can request to have CVE IDs associated with your program’s vulnerabilities, through which a CVE Assignment Authority (CNA) will then assign you a valid CVE ID and help you disclose the vulnerability.

As HackerOne is a CNA empowered to assign and work with customers in assisting them to disclose vulnerabilities, you can request to have CVE IDs associated with your program’s vulnerabilities through the HackerOne platform. HackerOne will automatically assign a CVE ID for your vulnerability and publish it to [MITRE](https://cve.mitre.org/) when you've publicly posted your security advisory. 

><i>Note: To opt-in to this feature, talk to your program manager or email support@hackerone.com</i>.

You can request a CVE ID straight from your report. To request a CVE ID from your report:
1. Go to the report in your inbox that you want to add a CVE ID to.
2. Click **Edit** next to ***References***.
