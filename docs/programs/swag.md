You'll see an overview of your swag orders that are sent and unsent as well as hacker mailing addresses. Hackers that haven't provided a mailing address or a T-shirt size will be asked to update their profile to provide the necessary information for them to receive swag.

You can select and de-select the checkboxes to manage which requests have been sent and unsent.
