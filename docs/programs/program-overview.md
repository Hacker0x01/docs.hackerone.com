The net report workload shows the cadence of how many reports were submitted and resolved over time. The graph specifically shows how many reports were submitted each month as well as how many reports are left unresolved from the month that they were submitted, which is known as the report burndown. In each month you can see the total number of reports that need to be worked on, giving you the net report workload.

The bounty budget calculator enables you to see if your program will be over or under budget by the fiscal year so that you can better plan how much you should budget for your bounties. You can input your budget as well as your start date and budget time frame by quarter or year, and an average will be calculated to predict your program’s future spending trend. The average is calculated based on your program’s previous bounty spending trends.
