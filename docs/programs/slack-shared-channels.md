Shared channels enable you to work with HackerOne in a single channel from your own workspace. Accessing shared channels from your own workspace enables you to adhere to the security standards of your own organization instead of having to implement the workspace login security standards of HackerOne. [Learn more about Slack’s shared channels](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/115004151203-A-guide-to-shared-channels).

Your workspace’s respective Slack administrator is responsible for adding members to the channel. For instance, HackerOne manages access to the channel for HackerOne members only, while your organization’s Slack admin will only grant access to members within your organization.

### Create a Shared Channel
Either you or HackerOne can initiate the shared channel set up process. To set up a shared channel:

1. [Create the channel in Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/360035092414-Create-shared-channels-Create-shared-channels#create-a-new-channel-1).
2. Create a sharing link as per [Slack’s instructions](https://slack.com/help/articles/360035092414-Create-shared-channels-Create-shared-channels#share-an-existing-channel-1).
3. Send the link for the channel to any HackerOne member.
4. Wait for the HackerOne administrator to approve the channel.
5. Approve the shared channel once you receive notification that the channel has been approved by HackerOne.

### Joining the HackerOne Slack Workspace as a Guest User
You can join HackerOne’s Customer Slack workspace (https://hackerone-customer.slack.com) as a guest user to have your team collaborate with HackerOne staff.

> **Note:** It’s your responsibility to inform HackerOne in a timely manner when a member’s access is to be revoked.

### About HackerOne's Slack
HackerOne uses Slack’s [Enterprise Grid](https://slack.com/help/articles/360004150931-What-is-Slack-Enterprise-Grid) with [Enterprise Key Management](https://slack.com/enterprise-key-management?cvosrc=helpcenter.helpcenter.helpcenter_ekm_help_center&cvo_creative=&utm_medium=helpcenter&utm_source=helpcenter&utm_campaign=_helpcenter_helpcenter____ob-_cr-_ym-) (EKM) enabled. When inviting customers to HackerOne’s Slack, HackerOne uses workspaces in our grid, including but not limited to hackerone-customer.slack.com, h1-pentest.slack.com, and h1-campaigns.slack.com. HackerOne makes these channels private or public at its discretion based on a number of factors. These workspaces are already restricted to a subset of HackerOne employees. In order to provide the best level of service, HackerOne avoids making some of these channels private so no one is prevented from supporting a customer when another employee is on vacation, the needs of the customer or project changes, or when employee leaves the organization. Customers who share channels via [Slack Connect](https://slack.com/help/articles/115004151203-A-guide-to-Slack-Connect) with HackerOne won’t have access to this workspace at all, and customers who have access as guests will have access only to the channels that are relevant to their organization(s). 

The use of Slack’s EKM enables HackerOne to own the encryption keys for all of HackerOne’s Slack workspaces, including `hackerone-customer.slack.com`. With regards to Slack Connect channels, Slack respects the individual workspaces and organizations settings for each message sent. Messages posted by HackerOne respect our settings, and messages sent from other organizations respect their settings and encryption.

All employees of HackerOne access Slack using Single Sign-On provided by our identity provider, Okta, along with Multi-Factor Authentication backed by Duo. Access to the external-facing Slack workspaces is limited to Customer Success team members, and a subset of employees, such as Product Managers, to enable their core job functions. In addition, administrators of the HackerOne Enterprise Grid organization (IT staff) have access to all of HackerOne's workspaces.
