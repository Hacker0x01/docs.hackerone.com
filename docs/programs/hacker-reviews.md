With Hacker Reviews, you have the option to send comments on hacker behavior to HackerOne and the hacker after closing a report. The reviews also enable the reviewer to highlight a key behavior which can allow HackerOne to award or assist the hacker accordingly. 

When giving a review, you can: 
* Choose whether to provide a positive or negative rating for the hacker.
* Select 1 of 4 preselected areas where the hacker excelled.
* Provide feedback to hackers and HackerOne about hacker behavior.

When the review is positive, the reviewer also has the option to leave a public endorsement on the hacker's profile page, which serves as an opportunity to tell the world about just how awesome the hacker is.
