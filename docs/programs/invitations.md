In order for hackers to hack on private programs, they must receive invitations. Hackers are able to receive invitations if they meet the following criteria:
* Established reputation
* Non-negative signal
* Clear record with zero code of conduct violations

HackerOne manages your invitations by:
* Daily checking to see if your program has met your report volume target in the last 30 days
* Inviting hackers for your program if you’re not reaching your report volume target

### How Invitations Work
The number of invitations HackerOne sends is based on your report volume on a rolling 30 day basis. These are the use cases as to how HackerOne sends invitations:

Case | Action
---- | ------
You're far from meeting your report volume. | HackerOne will gradually increase the number of invitations so you can meet your report volume.
You're receiving more reports while still being under your report volume.	| HackerOne will send out fewer invitations.
Your report volume is met. | Invitations will pause until the volume drops below the target in the 30 day window.
Your report volume is set to 0. | No invitations will be sent.

><i>Note: HackerOne will be sure to prevent you from being overwhelmed with reports.</i>

### Setting Invitations
To set your invitations:
1. Go to **Program Settings > Program > Hacker Management > Invitations**.
2. Enter the number of reports you’d like to receive every 30 days in the **Report volume** field. HackerOne recommends starting out by setting a target of receiving 5 valid reports every 30 days.
     * The report volume is measured by the amount of valid reports submitted in the past 30 days. Valid reports include reports that have been marked by you as <i>Triaged</i> or <i>Resolved</i>. Reports that are left in <i>New</i> or marked to any other state won't count toward this goal. Learn more about [report states](/programs/report-states.html).
3. Click **Save**.

### Manually Inviting Hackers
Sometimes you might want to issue your own invitations to hackers. If you need to issue your own invitations to particular hackers as an exception:
1. Go to **Program Settings > Program > Hacker Management > Invitations**.
2. Select how you want to invite the hacker in the sentence that starts with **Manually invite a hacker by**. You can choose to invite a hacker by selecting either:
   * Email
   * Username
   * Reputation

HackerOne doesn’t recommend inviting unknown hackers. If a hacker has reached out to request an invitation to your private program, contact HackerOne as this is a clear violation of Disclosure Guidelines.

### Managing Invitations
You can keep track of your invitations and which hackers have been invited to your program.
* The **Invited Hackers** section lists all of the hackers that have accepted invitations. You can select Remove next to the hacker you want to remove from your program.
* In the **Pending Invitations** section, you can cancel pending invitations.
