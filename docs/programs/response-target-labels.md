Inbox reports are marked with response labels to help you see which reports need to be taken action on. Reports that miss a response standard or target will have one of these action labels in the inbox:

Label | Details
----- | -------
Respond | A response is needed for the report.
Triage | The report needs to be triaged. 
Bounty | Award a bounty for the report. 
Resolve | Close the report. 

When a report misses:
* A response target: The label will be in yellow. 
* A response standard: The label will be in red. 

You can use the default inbox filter, *Missed Targets* to view all reports you need to take action on.
