### Export All Reports to a .csv File
You can export all vulnerability reports (or select/filtered reports) within your program. This enables you to keep and run analytics on your program's vulnerability report data in an organized spreadsheet. You can also export reports for any [child programs](parent-child-programs.html) associated with your program as well. *The .csv file doesn't include the comments from the reports.*

To export all of your reports:
1. Go to your program's **Program Settings > Program > Automation > Export Reports**.
