HackerOne offers a bi-directional Azure DevOps integration that enables you to synchronize your HackerOne events to Azure DevOps and vice versa, from Azure DevOps to HackerOne. This integration enables your development and security teams to stay aligned as it contributes to a better workflow of remediating security vulnerabilities by minimizing the manual back and forth between Azure DevOps and HackerOne.

> **Note:** This integration is only available to HackerOne Enterprise customers.

### Setup
To set up the bi-directional integration between HackerOne and your Azure DevOps instance, you’ll need to follow these 2 steps:
1. [Configure the integration on HackerOne](#configure-the-integration-on-hackerone)
2. [Configure outgoing requests on Azure DevOps](#configure-outgoing-requests)

### Configure the Integration on HackerOne
To set up your Azure DevOps integration on HackerOne:
1. Navigate to **Program Settings > Program > Integrations** on HackerOne
2. Click Connect with Azure DevOps.

### Configure Outgoing Requests
After configuring the integration on HackerOne, you’ll need to configure outgoing requests in Azure DevOps. This will enable you to send the configured events from Azure DevOps to HackerOne. Keep in mind that you’ll need to use Service Hooks in the configuration process.

To configure synchronizing events from Azure DevOps to HackerOne:
1. Go to **Project Settings > Service hooks** in Azure DevOps.
2. Click on **+ Create subscription**.
3. Choose **Web Hooks** from the services list.
