Advanced Vetting enables your program to have access to an exclusive community of background-checked finders. Background checked finders are active, high performing members of the HackerOne community that have satisfied strict background checks. Having these finders participate in your program ensures that trusted finders are partnered with you in finding vulnerabilities.

> **Note:** Advanced Vetting is available as an add-on. To opt-in to Advanced Vetting, contact your account manager.

To access your Advanced Vetting settings:
1. Go to: **Program > Hacker Management > Advanced Vetting**.
2. Click **View the full list of clear finders that have been invited to your program** to see which invited finders are Clear verified. Clear verified finders will be marked with this icon:

### How background checks work
HackerOne partners with Sterling Talent Solutions to conduct all global background checks. For all countries, the maximum criminal background check allowed by law is performed. Countries where it’s illegal to perform criminal background checks, unfortunately, won’t be eligible to participate in HackerOne Clear programs.

For finders based in the United States, these investigations are performed:

Investigation | Details
------------- | --------
Social Security Number Trace | Identifies residential address history and aliases.
Country Criminal Records Check | Identifies addresses and jurisdictions, including felony and misdemeanor criminal records.
State Criminal Records Check | Identifies addresses and jurisdictions, including felony and misdemeanor criminal records in Puerto Rico and 46 states.
Federal Criminal Records Check | Identifies addresses and jurisdictions, including felony and misdemeanor criminal records.
Enhanced Nationwide Records Check | Searches nationwide databases to identify potential jurisdictions in which the applicant may have worked, lived, gone to school, or committed a crime.
Sex Offender Records Check | Searches the US Department of Justice Sex Offender Registry to identify registered sex offenders, convictions, and/or infractions in 49 states.
Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Watchlist Check | Searches the U.S. Treasury Department watchlist to identify potential threats to national security.

### Digital Customizable Agreements
