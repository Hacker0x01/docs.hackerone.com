Phishing is essentially a form of information gathering or \"fishing\" for information.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/103.html\">CAPEC-103</a></td>\n<td>UI Redressing (Clickjacking)</td>\n<td>In a clickjacking attack the victim is tricked into unknowingly initiating some action in one system while interacting with the UI from a seemingly completely different system.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/141.html\">CAPEC-141</a></td>\n<td>Cache Poisoning</td>\n<td>An attacker exploits the functionality of cache technologies to cause specific data to be cached that aids the attackers' objectives. This describes any attack whereby an attacker places incorrect or harmful material in cache. The targeted cache can be an application's cache (e.g. a web browser cache) or a public cache (e.g. a DNS or ARP cache). Until the cache is refreshed, most applications or clients will treat the corrupted cache value as valid. This can lead to a wide range of exploits including redirecting web browsers towards sites that install malware and repeatedly incorrect calculations based on the incorrect value.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html\">CAPEC-209</a></td>\n<td>XSS Using MIME Type Mismatch</td>\n<td>An adversary creates a file with scripting content but where the specified MIME type of the file is such that scripting is not expected. The adversary tricks the victim into accessing a URL that responds with the script file. Some browsers will detect that the specified MIME type of the file does not match the actual type of its content and will automatically switch to using an interpreter for the real content type. If the browser does not invoke script filters before doing this, the adversary's script may run on the target unsanitized, possibly revealing the victim's cookies or executing arbitrary script in their browser.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/233.html\">CAPEC-233</a></td>\n<td>Privilege Escalation</td>\n<td>An adversary exploits a weakness enabling them to elevate their privilege and perform an action that they are not supposed to be authorized to perform.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/252.html\">CAPEC-252</a></td>\n<td>Local File Inclusion</td>\n<td>The attacker loads and executes an arbitrary local PHP file on a target machine. The attacker could use this to try to load old versions of PHP files that have known vulnerabilities, to load PHP files that the attacker placed on the local machine during a prior attack, or to otherwise change the functionality of the targeted application in unexpected ways.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/291.html\">CAPEC-291</a></td>\n<td>DNS Zone Transfers</td>\n<td>An attacker exploits a DNS misconfiguration that permits a ZONE transfer. Some external DNS servers will return a list of IP addresses and valid hostnames. Under certain conditions, it may even be possible to obtain Zone data about the organization's internal network. When successful the attacker learns valuable information about the topology of the target organization, including information about particular servers, their role within the IT structure, and possibly information about the operating systems running upon the network. This is configuration dependent behavior so it may also be required to search out multiple DNS servers while attempting to find one with ZONE transfers allowed.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/471.html\">CAPEC-471</a></td>\n<td>Search Order Hijacking</td>\n<td>An adversary exploits a weakness in an application's specification of external libraries to exploit the functionality of the loader where the process loading the library searches first in the same directory in which the process binary resides and then in other directories. Exploitation of this preferential search order can allow an attacker to make the loading process load the adversary's rogue library rather than the legitimate library. This attack can be leveraged with many different libraries and with many different loading processes. No forensic trails are left in the system's registry or file system that an incorrect library had been loaded.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/549.html\">CAPEC-549</a></td>\n<td>Malware</td>\n<td>An adversary installs and executes malicious code on the target system in an effort to achieve a negative technical impact.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/641.html\">CAPEC-641</a></td>\n<td>DLL Side-Loading</td>\n<td>An adversary places a malicious version of a Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) in the Windows Side-by-Side (WinSxS) directory to trick the operating system into loading this malicious DLL instead of a legitimate DLL. Programs specify the location of the DLLs to load via the use of WinSxS manifests or DLL redirection and if they aren't used then Windows searches in a predefined set of directories to locate the file. If the applications improperly specify a required DLL or WinSxS manifests aren't explicit about the characteristics of the DLL to be loaded, they can be vulnerable to side-loading.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html\">CWE-20</a></td>\n<td>Improper Input Validation</td>\n<td>The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html\">CWE-22</a></td>\n<td>Path Traversal</td>\n<td>The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html\">CWE-23</a></td>\n<td>Relative Path Traversal</td>\n<td>The software uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/35.html\">CWE-35</a></td>\n<td>Path Traversal: '.../...//'</td>\n<td>The software uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize '.../...//' (doubled triple dot slash) sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/75.html\">CWE-75</a></td>\n<td>Failure to Sanitize Special Elements into a Different Plane (Special Element Injection)</td>\n<td>The software does not adequately filter user-controlled input for special elements with control implications.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html\">CWE-77</a></td>\n<td>Command Injection - Generic</td>\n<td>The software constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html\">CWE-78</a></td>\n<td>OS Command Injection</td>\n<td>The software constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html\">CWE-79</a></td>\n<td>Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - DOM</td>\n<td>In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html\">CWE-79</a></td>\n<td>Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic</td>\n<td>The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html\">CWE-79</a></td>\n<td>Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected</td>\n<td>The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html\">CWE-79</a></td>\n<td>Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Stored</td>\n<td>The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html\">CWE-80</a></td>\n<td>Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)</td>\n<td>The software receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"&#x3C;\", \">\", and \"&#x26;\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html\">CWE-89</a></td>\n<td>SQL Injection</td>\n<td>The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/90.html\">CWE-90</a></td>\n<td>LDAP Injection</td>\n<td>The software constructs all or part of an LDAP query using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended LDAP query when it is sent to a downstream component.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/91.html\">CWE-91</a></td>\n<td>XML Injection</td>\n<td>The software does not properly neutralize special elements that are used in XML, allowing attackers to modify the syntax, content, or commands of the XML before it is processed by an end system.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/93.html\">CWE-93</a></td>\n<td>CRLF Injection</td>\n<td>The software uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html\">CWE-94</a></td>\n<td>Code Injection</td>\n<td>The software constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/98.html\">CWE-98</a></td>\n<td>Remote File Inclusion</td>\n<td>The PHP application receives input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before its usage in \"require,\" \"include,\" or similar functions.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/99.html\">CWE-99</a></td>\n<td>Resource Injection</td>\n<td>The software receives input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before it is used as an identifier for a resource that may be outside the intended sphere of control.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/113.html\">CWE-113</a></td>\n<td>HTTP Response Splitting</td>\n<td>The software receives data from an upstream component, but does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html\">CWE-119</a></td>\n<td>Memory Corruption - Generic</td>\n<td>The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write

Overflow</td>\n<td>The program copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html\">CWE-121</a></td>\n<td>Stack Overflow</td>\n<td>A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html\">CWE-122</a></td>\n<td>Heap Overflow</td>\n<td>A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/123.html\">CWE-123</a></td>\n<td>Write-what-where Condition</td>\n<td>Any condition where the attacker has the ability to write an arbitrary value to an arbitrary location, often as the result of a buffer overflow.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/124.html\">CWE-124</a></td>\n<td>Buffer Underflow</td>\n<td>The software writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a
