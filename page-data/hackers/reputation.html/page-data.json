Reputation is based exclusively on your track record as a hacker.</p>\n<p>There are a number of privileges that are gained by maintaining a high reputation, such as becoming eligible to receive invitations to private bug bounty programs. On the flip side, should your reputation decrease, the system will gradually reduce the number of report submissions allowed in a given time period.</p>\n<p>It's critical to this community that security teams be afforded a high-signal environment so that they can focus on providing a quality response to hackers who submit the best reports.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Reports with Disclosure Assistance have no effect to reputation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"effects-of-report-state-on-reputation\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#effects-of-report-state-on-reputation\" aria-label=\"effects of report state on reputation permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Effects of Report State on Reputation</h3>\n<p>A Hacker profile starts with a reputation of 100.

This enables programs to close multiple reports that have the same root cause as duplicates without affecting a hacker's reputation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Here's a common situation to keep in mind when calculating your reputation:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Report #123 is triaged and the hacker gains +7 reputation. You submit report #321 which is also triaged and you gain +7 reputation. Your report #321 is closed as a duplicate of report #123. While report #123 is still open, you still get to keep the +7 reputation. But, once report #123 is closed, your +7 reputation will be deducted.</p>\n<p><strong>There are situations where duplicates can be \"chained\" together.</strong> For example: report #911 is a duplicate of report #888 which is a duplicate of report #311 which was marked as N/A. In this example, report #911 would get -5 reputation because it was the duplicate of a duplicate N/A report. However, we end the chain at the third duplicate. This means that any other duplicate reports that are added after the third report in the chain will automatically get 0 reputation no matter the state of the report for which it's a duplicate of.</i></p>\n<h3 id=\"effects-of-bounties-on-reputation\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#effects-of-bounties-on-reputation\" aria-label=\"effects of bounties on reputation permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Effects of Bounties on Reputation</h3>\n<p>The bounty amount you receive also impacts your reputation. Different bounty amounts grant you reputation based on the standard deviation from the program's mean bounty amount.

After 10 bounties have been paid out, a hacker’s reputation will be recalculated based on the standard deviation of the program’s mean bounty.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><i><b>Note:</b> We don't award reputation when rewarded with a bonus and not a bounty.</i></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"effects-of-collaboration-on-reputation\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#effects-of-collaboration-on-reputation\" aria-label=\"effects of collaboration on reputation permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Effects of Collaboration on Reputation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Collaborators will receive full reputation for report state changes (e.g. validity of the report).
