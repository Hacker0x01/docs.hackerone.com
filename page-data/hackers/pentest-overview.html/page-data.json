Teams are formed based on skills required for the pentest as well as living in similar timezones and speaking a common language so that teams can best work and communicate together.</li>\n<li>The pentest will launch and the team will have 2 weeks to complete the pentest. Any reports created during the pentest will be submitted using HackerOne.</li>\n<li>After testing has been completed, the lead pentester will draft and submit a summary report of the team's findings.</li>\n<li>Once the vulnerabilities have been remediated, the pentest team will retest the vulnerabilities to make sure they’re fixed.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"applying-for-a-pentest\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#applying-for-a-pentest\" aria-label=\"applying for a pentest permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Applying for a pentest</h3>\n<p>Once you’ve been approved to be a part of the pentest community, you’ll be able to view and apply to different pentest opportunities. You need to apply to participate in each pentest because different pentests require different skill sets, and we want to make sure your experience best matches with the opportunity.</p>\n<p>To find and apply for pentests:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the <strong>Directory</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select the <strong>Pentest</strong> tab to view what pentest opportunities are available. For each pentest, you can view:\n<ul>\n<li>Dates of the pentest</li>\n<li>The payout range</li>\n<li>The number of hours required to complete the pentest</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>View more and apply</strong> button for the pentest you're interested in.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Submit 1-click application</strong> to apply for the pentest.</li>\n<li>(Optional) Click the button again to revoke your application.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Pentests don’t award bounties for any new vulnerabilities found through the pentest. Retests, however, are required for each vulnerability and are included in the financial rewards for the pentest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After you apply, HackerOne's technical program managers will review your application for the pentest and place you on a pentesting team if your skills are a good fit for the program.</p>\n<h3 id=\"submitting-a-pentest-check\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#submitting-a-pentest-check\" aria-label=\"submitting a pentest check permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Submitting a Pentest Check</h3>\n<p>Each pentest is comprised of different security checklists that are based on the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities.

You'll also be able to rate each of the pentesters you worked with and provide constructive feedback to help them improve in their skills. The program and your fellow pentesters will also have the ability to provide feedback regarding working with you.</p>\n<p>To view your feedback:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to your profile's <strong>Settings > My Feedback</strong>.</li>\n<li>(<em>Optional</em>) Click the checkbox next for <strong>Show this blurb on my profile</strong> to publish your feedback onto your public profile page.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep in mind that you'll only be able to see a review left by a fellow pentester if you've submitted a review for them.
