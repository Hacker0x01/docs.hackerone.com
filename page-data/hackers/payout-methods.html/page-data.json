How fast you receive your payout depends on the type of payment you're using as well as your bank. There are cases where hackers have received payments on the same day and cases where hackers have had to wait the full 10 business days. Bank transfers can be done in your own local currency. To convert bounties to your local currency, the mid-market rate is used to convert money. This saves you up to 5% compared to relying on your bank to convert the money to your local currency.</br><br>Make sure your bank isn’t on the sanctions list. Go to <a href=\"https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/\">https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/</a> to check if your bank is on the list. Banks on this list don’t qualify for bank transfers. Examples include VTB and SBERBANK.</br><br><strong>Note on payment limits:</strong> we attempt to pay the largest payment in a single transaction allowed to us by the currency exchanges. This will vary by currency and whether it is a Priority or Regular payment.
