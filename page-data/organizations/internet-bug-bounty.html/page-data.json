One of the best solutions to defend against threats facing the software supply chain is to work together to protect these key dependencies. Just as open-source software is enhanced through the community, the community should help to secure it—and the Internet Bug Bounty program was built to facilitate that joint effort.</p>\n<h3 id=\"who-should-participate\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#who-should-participate\" aria-label=\"who should participate permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Who Should Participate?</h3>\n<p>The IBB is open to any bug bounty customer on the HackerOne platform.

This bounty table is private and indicates how much you will award for vulnerabilities discovered in open-source projects. Our default suggestion for IBB bounty spend is for customers to allocate 10% of their main bounty spend. Amounts within the table are adjustable and can be increased or decreased depending on your needs.</p>\n<p>Once this table is enabled and configured, the amounts of the individual bounty table are pooled with the bounty tables from other participating programs. The sum of those amounts is displayed in the public bounty table on the IBB Program page. This is rewarded for all valid vulnerability submissions for all open-source projects enrolled.</p>\n<p>When a new bounty program opts in or an adjustment is made to an existing individual IBB bounty table, the public IBB bounties offered for open-source vulnerabilities are immediately increased.</p>\n<p>To opt-in and set up your individual IBB bounty table on your security page:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <strong>Engagements > Settings > Program > Bounties.</strong></li>\n<li>Input the bounty value amount that represents 10% of your main bounty table or that best fits the reward structure of your program.</li>\n<li>This default asset for this table is already set to <strong>Internet Bug Bounty.</strong></li>\n<li>Input your bounty amounts under each column.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Create bounty table.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 500px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 52.800000000000004%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"IBB Bounty Table\"\n        title=\"IBB Bounty Table\"\n        src=\"/static/62ff94dbb76c4a9d1b2c9a8c133e644d/0b533/ibb-1.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/62ff94dbb76c4a9d1b2c9a8c133e644d/fac75/ibb-1.png 125w,\n/static/62ff94dbb76c4a9d1b2c9a8c133e644d/63868/ibb-1.png 250w,\n/static/62ff94dbb76c4a9d1b2c9a8c133e644d/0b533/ibb-1.png 500w,\n/static/62ff94dbb76c4a9d1b2c9a8c133e644d/1d69c/ibb-1.png 750w,\n/static/62ff94dbb76c4a9d1b2c9a8c133e644d/00d43/ibb-1.png 1000w,\n/static/62ff94dbb76c4a9d1b2c9a8c133e644d/0ff19/ibb-1.png 2084w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Your allocated bounty amounts for the IBB will be added to the public IBB bounty pool total immediately.

Additionally, you can opt out at any point.</p>\n<p><strong>How can I track how much I’m spending?</strong>\nMonthly transactions to the IBB bounty pool can be viewed in your program billing history.</p>\n<p><strong>What results can we hope to see from the IBB?</strong>\nWe’ll provide public, monthly reporting of vulnerabilities (including CVEs) and associated payouts.</p>\n<p><strong>Which projects are currently supported?</strong>\nCheck out our list of projects <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/ibb/policy_scopes\">here.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Can I recommend projects for enrollment in the IBB?</strong>\nYes! We are always looking to onboard new critical open-source projects. If you have a project that is critical in your environment and would like to see it enrolled in the IBB, send the project details to <a href=\"mailto:ibb@hackerone.com\">ibb@hackerone.com</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Projects are nominated by both customers and hackers. If you have projects you’d like to see supported, email <a href=\"mailto:ibb@hackerone.com\">ibb@hackerone.com</a> with the project information.</li>\n<li>Once a project has been nominated by multiple parties (3+), they will be assessed for enrollment criteria</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Which projects are eligible for enrollment?</strong>\nThe IBB aims to support open-source projects that embody widespread dependency for our customers and hackers. An additional goal is to increase security maturity for all open-source software. To that end, we encourage all projects to use the <a href=\"https://openssf.org/blog/2020/11/06/security-scorecards-for-open-source-projects/\">OpenSSF Security Scorecard</a> as a starting point before they consider participating in a bug bounty program. Once a project has achieved basic security maturity, we consider the following before enrolling a project in the IBB.</p>\n<p>Additionally, to be considered for enrollment projects must have the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a security policy governing the receipt of vulnerability reports (e.g., SECURITY.md)</li>\n<li>Have a process to assign CVEs and/or issue security advisories for valid vulnerabilities reports</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What if a project does not have a way to receive donations?</strong>\nThe project may direct the funds to be sent to any other non-profit organization of their choice.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I sponsor bounties in commercial third-party software? (e.g., SolarWinds)</strong>\nWe believe the model can be applied to commercial software as well, and we plan to pursue this as the top priority for Phase 2.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/organizations/internet-bug-bounty.html","id":"organizations/internet-bug-bounty","title":"Internet Bug Bounty","description":null},"headings":[{"value":"What is it?"},{"value":"Impact to Date"},{"value":"Why Participate?"},{"value":"Who Should Participate?"},{"value":"How Does it Work?"},{"value":"How to Set Up Your IBB Bounty Table"},{"value":"Common FAQs"}]}},"pageContext":{}},
