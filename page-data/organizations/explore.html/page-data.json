This enables you to take a deep dive into your data to see what areas you need to focus on to improve your program. You can also create benchmarks and specify the kinds of programs you want to compare your program to based on program type, industry, and company headcount.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Creating benchmarks is currently only available for Enterprise programs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To access your response targets dashboard:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <strong>Program Dashboard > Explore</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select the appropriate variables for these fields:</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Details</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Metric</td>\n<td>What you want to measure. <br><br>You can choose from: <br><li><a href=\"response-target-metrics.html\">Response Targets</a> metrics:<ul><li>Median <a href=\"response-target-metrics.html\">time to resolution</a><li>Median <a href=\"response-target-metrics.html\">time to triage</a><li>Median <a href=\"response-target-metrics.html\">time to bounty</a><li>Median <a href=\"response-target-metrics.html\">time to first response</a><li>Missed resolution targets<li>Missed triage targets <li>Missed bounty targets <li>Missed first response targets</ul> <li><a href=\"report-states.html\">Submissions metrics</a><ul><li>Needs more info <li>Resolved<li>Closed as Duplicate<li>Closed as N/A<li>Closed as Informative<li>Closed as Spam<li>Closed<li>Re-opened<li>Triaged<li>Submitted</ul> <li>Spend metrics:<ul><li>Number of Bounties Paid<li>Sum of Bounties Paid</ul><br><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Median</em> is the midpoint of your dataset.

From the metrics, you can drill down into specific data spikes and compare yourself to previous time periods.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Case 2: Compare yourself to other programs</strong>\n<br>You want to understand how well your company is doing in terms of response speed, but you don’t have a clear understanding of what’s considered a “good” speed. Looking at internal data isn’t enough because you have no idea if the company’s security team is doing well compared to the industry at large.</p>\n<p>By choosing <strong>Benchmarks</strong> in Explore, you can gain insights to your program performance against aggregated market data against other companies based on program type, industry and company headcount.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/organizations/explore.html","id":"organizations/explore","title":"Explore","description":null},"headings":[{"value":"Use Cases"}]}},"pageContext":{}},
