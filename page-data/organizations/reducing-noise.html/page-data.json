Though publicly launching your program is a huge accomplishment, it also means that your program is more susceptible to noise from invalid or low-impact reports. Receiving such reports makes it difficult to maintain healthy programs with healthy response times as programs are spending time filtering through these low priority reports.</p>\n<p>In order to help you and your program become more successful, HackerOne has implemented features to help you reduce noise from low-impact reports. These features include:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Feature</th>\n<th>Details</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/organizations/triggers.html\">Triggers</a></td>\n<td>Set up an automated action when your program receives a report with or without a given trigger word. Triggers aid in reducing noise as they can flag certain reports.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/organizations/signal-requirements.html\">Signal Requirements</a></td>\n<td>Set a minimum Signal hackers must reach in order to submit reports to your program. This ensures that only hackers with a certain skill level are able to report vulnerabilities.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/organizations/defining-scope.html\">Define your Scope</a></td>\n<td>Define your scope and the assets you want hackers to hack on. This guides hackers to focus on the right targets that you’re interested in.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/hackers/reputation.html\">Reputation</a></td>\n<td>Flagging noisy reports as <i>Not Applicable</i> or <i>Spam</i> will negatively impact a hacker's reputation. The built-in reputation system incentivizes hackers to submit quality reports over noise.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"hackbot.html\">Hackbot</a></td>\n<td>HackerOne's free automated service that provides inline guidance in reports with contextual advice and actionable suggestions. For instance, you can set Hackbot to suggest when a report <em>Needs more info</em>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Report Abuse</td>\n<td>In extreme cases, you can ban sources of noise from your program by <a href=\"/organizations/banning-hackers.html\">banning hackers</a> that are submitting irrelevant reports and <a href=\"/organizations/hacker-mediation.html\">requesting mediation</a> from HackerOne.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Triage Services</td>\n<td>Contact your Account Manager if you're interested in learning more about support from HackerOne's Security Analysts in our fully managed offering.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>You’re free to implement 1 or all of these features. For the best results in reducing unwanted noise for your program, it’s good practice to set up each one.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/organizations/reducing-noise.html","id":"organizations/reducing-noise","title":"Reducing Noise","description":null},"headings":[]}},"pageContext":{}},
