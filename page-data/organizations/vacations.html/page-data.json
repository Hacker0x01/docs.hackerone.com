To notify hackers, you can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use a trigger to set an automated response</li>\n<li>Update your Security Page by stating that response, triage, and resolution will take longer than normal</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's best if you include as much information as possible and a timeline of when you expect your program to resume.</p>\n<p>HackerOne doesn't recommend that you pause submissions as it can be difficult to re-engage hackers after the pause ends. If you expect the disruption to last for a significant amount of time, please <a href=\"https://support.hackerone.com\">contact HackerOne</a> to discuss your situation.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/organizations/vacations.html","id":"organizations/vacations","title":"Vacations","description":null},"headings":[]}},"pageContext":{}},
