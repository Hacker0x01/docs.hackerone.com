In return, the finders of the vulnerabilities are rewarded with monetary prizes.</p>\n<p>BBPs have the option to be <a href=\"private-vs-public-programs.html\">private or public</a>, where you can choose which will work best for you. BBPs are also a bit more complex than VDPs as there are a lot more components and settings to configure such as a bounty structure and response targets.
