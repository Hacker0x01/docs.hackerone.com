In order to help you write a good policy, HackerOne provides a baseline policy on your Security Page to help you get started.  We recommend including the following in your policy:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Section</th>\n<th>Details</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Disclosure Policy</td>\n<td>Provide a basic disclosure agreement for your invited hackers. One easy way is to state that you'll abide by <a href=\"https://www.hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines\">HackerOne's disclosure guidelines</a>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bounty Program</td>\n<td>Define the vulnerability types you care about most and provide information on your reward structure.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Exclusions</td>\n<td>Create exclusions for the vulnerabilities hackers should ignore.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scope</td>\n<td>List the assets in scope for your program.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Some successful security pages you can refer to as examples are: <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/twitter\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/yahoo\">Yahoo</a>.</p>\n<p>Other best practices to keep in mind are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep your policy succinct.</strong> Longer policies may lose readership toward the end.</li>\n<li><strong>Set clear expectations with hackers.</strong> If your response time or fix time is much longer than recommended, state it in your policy. It's good practice to respond to researchers within 3-5 days and to have complete fixes within 45 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Give responses updating a hacker that you're still reviewing a report.</strong> Such actions let hackers know that their work hasn't gone into a black hole.</li>\n<li><strong>Re-evaluate your policy on a recurring basis.</strong> Your policy will and should change as your bug bounty program matures.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"path":"/organizations/good-policies.html","id":"organizations/good-policies","title":"Good Policies","description":null},"headings":[]}},"pageContext":{}},
