If a hacker falls below the threshold, they will have a restricted number of reports they can submit to your program. This will improve the quality of reports programs can expect to receive from hackers.</p>\n<p>The signal used for signal requirements is calculated based on a rolling 365-day window. This means that a hacker’s signal is based on their activity from the last 365 days.</p>\n<p>To enable Signal Requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <strong>Program Settings > Program > Hacker Management > Submission</strong>.</li>\n<li>Choose from 1 of these 4 options in the <strong>Signal Requirements</strong> section:</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Details</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Strict (≥ 1.0 Signal)</td>\n<td>Hackers with a proven record are unrestricted, while hackers who don't meet this requirement will have a limited number of allowed submissions to your program. A strict setting makes sense for teams that prefer fewer, higher quality reports or that can only handle a smaller flow of reports  as it most tightly limits hacker participation based on high Signal. This is the recommended setting for new programs.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Standard (≥ 0.0 Signal)</td>\n<td>The recommended setting for most programs.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lenient (≥ -1.0 Signal)</td>\n<td>Recommended for experienced programs that want to maximize the number of hackers that'll help find vulnerabilities.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Turn off Signal Requirements</td>\n<td>Any hacker with any level of Signal will be able to submit reports to your program. Recommended for veteran programs only.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><i>Note: Turning Signal Requirements down or off is better for teams that value having the maximum number of hackers to help find issues.</i></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When hackers don't meet the Signal Requirement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They can submit a capped number of vulnerability reports.</li>\n<li>They are capped to submit only 5 reports every 30 days.</li>\n<li>The number of capped reports they can submit resets every 30 days.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is a program limit for capped reports and a total platform limit for reports sent to programs by these hackers. This provides all hackers with the opportunity to participate in a program, even if their Signal doesn't meet the program requirements.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/organizations/signal-requirements.html","id":"organizations/signal-requirements","title":"Signal Requirements","description":null},"headings":[]}},"pageContext":{}},
