Slack serves as our main communication hub. For real-time, synchronous interactions, pentesters can utilize Slack's Video and Audio calling features.</p>\n<p>For each pentest, there are two distinct Slack channels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Customer Channel:</strong> This channel includes both the customer contacts and the HackerOne team.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pentester Channel:</strong> Exclusive to the HackerOne team, this channel provides a space for internal discussions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We encourage all involved parties to actively participate and utilize these channels for a streamlined pentesting experience.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ℹ️ <strong>The Value of Real-time Pentester Communication</strong><br />Once testers are approved, they gain Slack access, enabling them to communicate directly with customers and relevant HackerOne staff within shared channels. Our pentest community manager remains readily available for queries and discussions. This exclusive access empowers our pentester community as well as customer teams, fostering continuous feedback on findings, direct assistance, and consistent high-quality results.<br />In such time-sensitive engagements, real-time communication and trust are crucial, as any delay can significantly affect outcomes.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"path":"/organizations/pentest-reporting.html","id":"organizations/pentest-reporting","title":"Reporting","description":null},"headings":[]}},"pageContext":{}},
